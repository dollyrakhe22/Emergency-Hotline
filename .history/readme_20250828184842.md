<No:1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector & querySelectorAll?>
=> 
**getElementById:
.Selects one element in the page that has a specific ID.
.ID is unique, so it will only find one element..
.Fastest method because it directly looks for that unique ID.

**getElementsByClassName:
.Selects all elements that share a specific class name.

Can return multiple elements.

The collection it returns changes automatically if the page updates (live collection).
