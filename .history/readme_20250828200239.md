<Question-No:1-.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector & querySelectorAll?>
=> 
**getElementById:
.Selects one element in the page that has a specific ID.
.ID is unique, so it will only find one element..
.Fastest method because it directly looks for that unique ID.

**getElementsByClassName:
.Selects all elements that share a specific class name.
.Can return multiple elements.
.The collection it returns changes automatically if the page updates.

**querySelector:
.Selects the first element that matches any CSS-style selector (ID, class, tag, or combination).
.More flexible than getElementById or getElementsByClassName.
.Only finds the first match, even if multiple elements match.

**querySelectorAll:
.Selects all elements that match any CSS-style selector.
.Very flexible because it can use complex selectors like nested elements, pseudo-classes, etc.
